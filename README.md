## Why Juju?

* Reduce complexity  
* Enable repeatability  
* Codify operations knowledge  
* Simplify day two 
* Maintain portability

If your infrastructure can’t be understood by everyone in your organisation, there’s an issue.
Juju focuses on the applications that your deployment defines and how they are related.

Requiring everyone to know every hostname, every machine, every subnet and every storage volume is brittle.
This means change is complicated, on-boarding is difficult and tends to create knowledge silos.
Juju makes those details available, but places the deployment model at the front.

With Juju, your team maintains a practical high-level view that makes your backend more adaptable to changes over time. 
Extending your product should be as simple as deploying its first prototype.


## What is Juju?

Juju is a devops tool that reduces operational complexity through application modelling.
Once a model is described, Juju identifies the necessary steps to make that model a reality.

Juju has three core concepts: models, applications and relations.
Consider a whiteboard drawing of your service.
The whiteboard's border is the model, its circles are applications and the lines between the circles are relations.

Juju uses an active agent deployed alongside your applications.
That agent orchestrates infrastructure, and manages applications through the product life cycle.
